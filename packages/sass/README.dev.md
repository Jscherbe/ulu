# Purpose of this library

- To keep reusable parts
- To keep them encapsulated
- No fancy methods to import
  - User figures out how to import library from node_module (like other sass libraries)
- Maybe some pieces will need to be available throughout all components
  - (ie. core vars and mixins)

Todos:
  - [ ] Row headers
    + Probably limited to single rows no rowspan
  - [ ] Column Actions Accessibility Solution
    + Can't  use aria hidden on focusable elements (clone headers) 
    + Instead use focusable (keyboard) actions only in the actual table header
      - Then make the table scroll up when the user focuses a column action?
      - This avoids focusable elements in the duplicated headers

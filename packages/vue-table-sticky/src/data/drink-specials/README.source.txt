   CHANGES TO THE DATA

   EXPLANATORY NOTES AND LIMITATIONS
   =================================

Explanatory Notes and Limitations Applicable to All APIS Policy Topics

1.   State law may permit local jurisdictions to impose requirements in addition to those mandated by State law. Alternatively, State law may prohibit local legislation on this topic, thereby preempting local powers. For more information on the preemption doctrine, see the About Alcohol Policy page. APIS does not document policies established by local governments.

2.   In addition to statutes and regulations, judicial decisions (case law) also may affect alcohol-related policies. APIS does not review case law except to determine whether judicial decisions have invalidated statutes or regulations that would otherwise affect the data presented in the comparison tables.

3.   APIS reviews published administrative regulations. However, administrative decisions or directives that are not included in a State's published regulatory codes may have an impact on implementation. This possibility has not been addressed by the APIS research.

4.   Statutes and regulations cited in tables on this policy topic may have been amended or repealed after the specific date or time period specified by the site user's search criteria.

5.   Policy changes in APIS are presented as of the date these changes take effect as law.  Users should be aware that in some situations there may be a delay between the effective date of a law and the time a corresponding policy change occurs in practice.  Because APIS research is based entirely on primary legal source materials (codified statutes and regulations and, on rare occasions, published court opinions), APIS is unable to accurately determine when policy changes may appear in practice.

6.   If a conflict exists between a statute and a regulation addressing the same legal issue, APIS coding relies on the statute.

7.   A comprehensive understanding of the data presented in the comparison tables for this policy topic requires examination of the applicable Row Notes and Jurisdiction Notes, which can be accessed from the body of the table via links in the Jurisdiction column.


Explanatory Notes and Limitations Specifically Applicable to Drink Specials

This analysis does not consider or address the following:
•  	Provisions that prohibit sales of alcoholic beverages below cost.
•  	Laws that merely prohibit advertising a drink special or sale as opposed to conducting the drink special or sale itself.
•  	Provisions regarding samplings or limited tastings of alcoholic beverages.
•  	Provisions regarding promotional events, such as "pub crawls."
•  	Exemptions, such as a statute that exempts promotions offered at military establishments.
•  	Provisions that govern price promotions and discounts for off-premises consumption.

APIS does not interpret laws prohibiting “free beverages” or prohibiting the sale of drinks for a price “less than the price usually charged” for such drinks as also prohibiting such practices as 2-for-1 or 3-for-1 drink specials.  Rather, APIS requires a specific reference to multiple servings for a single price being prohibited for purposes of coding the Multiple Serving for Single Serving Price variable.



   COLUMN DEFINITIONS (VARIABLES)
   ==============================

1.  Free Beverages
•         A checkmark appears in the Free Beverages column if the State prohibits on-premises retailers from providing free alcoholic beverages to patrons either as a promotional practice or on a case-by-case basis (e.g., on a birthday or anniversary, as compensation for poor service, etc.).
 
2.  Multiple Servings at One Time
•         A checkmark appears in the Multiple Servings at One Time column if the State prohibits on-premises retailers from serving a customer more than one drink at a time without regard to price, as in the retail practice of “lining up” drinks in front of a customer whether or not he/she is paying full price for each drink.  Two different alcoholic beverages served at the same time to a single customer, if such “drink” is a customary combination (such as a shot of spirituous liquor with a malt beverage), is considered one drink.
 
3.  Multiple Servings for a Single Serving Price
•         A checkmark appears in the Multiple Servings for a Single Serving Price column if the State prohibits on-premises retailers from serving a customer multiple servings for a single price (e.g. two-for-one, three-for-one, etc.). 
 
4.  Happy Hours -- Reduced Price
a.     Type of provision
o    Banned—State prohibits offering a discount or price promotion to customers during any subset of normal hours of operation (such as reduced prices during “Happy Hours”).  States that ban price promotions during a subset of business hours may allow promotions that last for a full business day (Full Day Price Reductions – see Definitions).  Such States are coded as “banned” by APIS.
o    Restricted—State allows on-premises establishments to offer a discount or price promotion to customers but there are restrictions or limitations as to the hours or days the specials may be offered.
o    None—No law exists prohibiting happy hours. 
b.     Description
o    For States that allow on-premises discounts or price promotions but with restrictions to a subset of business hours, this column indicates the days and/or times during which such discounts or promotions are permitted.
o    For States that ban on-premises discounts or price promotions for a subset of business hours, this column indicates those that do not ban such promotions if offered for a full business day (Full Day Price Reductions).
 
5.  Unlimited Beverages for a Fixed Price or Period
•         A checkmark appears in the Unlimited Beverages for a Fixed Price or Period column if the State prohibits the price promotion practice of allowing patrons to receive an unlimited number of alcoholic drinks for a fixed price or during a fixed period of time (e.g., all-you-can-drink, beat-the-clock, etc.).
 
6.  Increased Volume without Increase in Price
•         A checkmark appears in the Increased Volume without Increase in Price column if the State prohibits offering drinks with increased amounts of alcohol at the same price as regular-sized drinks (e.g., double shots for the price of single shots).
